Developed a Java based Object Oriented mobile game application for the purpose of applying advanced Object Oriented concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. The application was also meant to incorporate programming techniques such as design patterns and strategy implementation for non-player controlled characters, a  complete Graphical User Interface and animation for visual effects and moving objects.
